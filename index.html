          <p class="about-text">“The places we have known do not belong solely to the world of space... but were only a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time.” — Marcel Proust 
          <br>
            Noctis, named after the Latin word for “night,” is a digital exploration of memory, war, and the way the past is never truly lost—only waiting to be recalled. Inspired by Proust’s In Search of Lost Time, the website reimagines his philosophy of involuntary memory through the lens of soldiers and night vision, where fragmented recollections emerge from the darkness of war. In 'In Search of Lost Time,' Proust illustrates how the past is not recovered as it once was but rather reconstructed, layered with meaning, shaped by time, and transformed by memory itself. The famous madeleine scene demonstrates how a single taste can awaken an entire world of forgotten experiences, stitching together scattered fragments into a vivid, living whole. Similarly, Noctis pieces together echoes of war—faint voices, lost letters, fleeting sensations—reconstructing a narrative where soldiers navigate both the battlefield and the shifting landscapes of their own recollections. The site takes passages from Proust’s work and interweaves them with the experience of war, creating a storyline where memory is not merely a record of the past but an act of creation. Just as Proust’s narrator discovers that remembering is a way of reshaping time, Noctis suggests that soldiers, too, carry their wars not as static histories, but as evolving stories—some fading, some sharpening in the darkness of night. In war, as in memory, the past is never still. It flickers in and out of sight, waiting for the right moment to be seen again.</p>
